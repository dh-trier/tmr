the

on
the
HEARTH
a
fairy
tale
of
home
chirp
the
first
the

begin
it
!
do
not
tell
i
what
mrs.
peerybingle
say|said
.
i
know
well
.
mrs.
peerybingle
may
leave
it
on
record
to
the
end
of
time
that
she
could
not
say
which
of
they
begin
it
;
but
i
say
the
kettle
do
.
i
ought
to
know
,
i
hope
?
the
kettle
begin
it
,
full
five
minute
by
the
little
waxy-faced
dutch
clock
in
the
corner
,
before
the
cricket
utter
a
chirp
.
as
if
the
clock
have
not
finish|finished
striking|strike
,
and
the
convulsive
little
Hay-maker
at
the
top
of
it
,
jerk|jerking
away
right
and
leave|left
with
a
scythe
in

of
a
moorish
palace
,
have
not
mow
down
half
an
acre
of
imaginary
grass
before
the
cricket
join|joined

!
why
,
i
be
not
naturally
positive
.
every
one
know
that
i
would
not
set
i
own
opinion
against
the
opinion
of
mrs.
peerybingle
,
unless
i
be
quite
sure
,
on
any
account
whatever
.
nothing
should
induce
i
.
but
,
this
be
a
question
of
fact
.
and
the
fact
be
,
that
the
kettle
begin
it
at
least
five
minute
before
the
cricket
give
any
sign
of
be
in
existence
.
contradict
i
,
and
i
will
say
ten
.
let
i
narrate
exactly
how
it
happen
.
i
should
have
proceed
to
do
so
,
in
i
very
first
word
,
but
for
this
plain
consideration
---
if
i
be
to
tell
a
story
i
must
begin
at
the
beginning|begin
;
[

]
and
how
be
it
possible
to
begin
at
the
beginning|begin
without
begin|beginning
at
the
kettle
?
it
appear
as
if
there
be
a
sort
of
match
,
or
trial
of
skill
,
you
must
understand
,
between
the
kettle
and
the
cricket
.
and
this
be
what
lead
to
it
,
and
how
it
come
about
.
mrs.
peerybingle
,
go|going
out
into
the
raw
twilight
,
and
click|clicking
over

mrs.

at
the
water-butt
.
presently
return|returning
,
less
the
patten
(
and
a
good
deal
less
,
for
they
be
tall
,
and
mrs.
peerybingle
be
but
short
)
,
she
set
the
kettle
on
the
fire
.
in
do
which
she
lose|lost
she
temper
,
or
mislay
it
for
an
instant
;
for
,
the

uncomfortably

and
in

,
sleety
sort

(
with

)
upon

particularly
neat
in

we
find
this
,
for
the
moment
,
hard
to
bear

besides
,
the
kettle
be
aggravate|aggravating
and
obstinate
.
it
would
not

on

;
it

kindly
to

it
would
lean
forward
with
a
drunken
air

,
a
very
idiot
of
a

on
the

it

then
,
with

pertinacity
deserving

,
dive
sideways
in

down
to
the
very
bottom
of

and
the

have
never
make
half
the
monstrous
resistance
to

the
water
which
the

of
that

employ|employed
against
mrs.

before
she
get

up

it
look
sullen
and
pig-headed
enough
,
even
then
;
carry|carrying

it
handle
with
an
air
of
defiance
,
and
cock
it
spout
pertly
and

,
as
if

mrs.

,
with

she
chubby

against

and
sit
down
before

meantime
,
the
jolly
blaze
uprose
and
fall|fell
,
flash|flashing
and
gleam|gleaming
on
the
little
Hay-maker
at
the
top
of
the
dutch
clock
,
until
one
might
have
think
he
stand
stock-still
before
the
moorish
palace
,
and
nothing
be
in
motion
but
the
flame
.
he
be
on
the
move
,
however
;
and
have
he
spasm
,
two
to
the
second
,
all
right
and
regular
.
but
he
suffering
when
the
clock
be
go|going
to
strike
be
frightful
to
behold
;
and
when
a
cuckoo
look
out
of
a
trap-door
in
the
palace
,
and
give
note
six
time
,
it
shake
he
,
each
time
,
like
a
spectral
voice
---
or
like
a
something
wiry
pluck|plucking
at
he
leg
.
it
be
not
until
a
violent
commotion
and
a
whirring|whir
noise
among
the
weight
and
rope
below
he
have
quite
subside
that
this
terrified|terrify
Hay-maker
become
himself
again
.
nor
be
he
startled|startle
without
reason
;
for
these
rattling|rattle
,
bony
skeleton
of
clock
be
very
disconcerting|disconcert
in
they
operation
,
and
i
wonder
very
much
how
any
set
of
man
,
but
most
of
all
how
dutchman
,
can
have
have
a
liking|like
to
invent
they
.
there
be
a
popular
belief
that
dutchman
love
broad
case
and
much
clothing|clthe
for
they
own
low
self
;
and
they
might
know
well
than
to
leave
they
clock
so
very
lank
and
unprotected
,
surely
.
now
it
be
,
you
observe
,
that
the
kettle
begin
to
spend
the
evening
.
now
it
be
that
the
kettle
,
grow|growing
mellow
and
musical
,
begin
to
have
irrepressible
gurgling
in
it
throat
,
and
to
indulge
in
short
vocal
snort
,
which
it
check|checked
in
the
bud
,
as
if
it
have
not
quite
make
up
it
mind
yet
to
be
good
company

now
it
be
that
after
two
or
three
such
vain
attempt
to
stifle
it
convivial
sentiment
,
it
throw|threw
off
all
moroseness
,
all
reserve
,
[

]
and
burst
into
a
stream
of
song
so
cosy
and
hilarious
as
never
maudlin
nightingale
yet
form
the
least
idea
of
.
so
plain
,
too
!
bless
you
,
you
might
have
understand|understood
it
like
a
book
---
good
than
some
book
you
and
i
could
name
,
perhaps
.
with
it
warm
breath
gush
forth
in
a
light
cloud
which
merrily
and
gracefully
ascend
a
few
foot
,
then
hang|hung
about
the
chimney-corner
as
it
own
domestic
heaven
,
it
troll
it
song
with
that
strong
energy
of
cheerfulness
,
that
it
iron
body
hum
and
stir
upon
the
fire
;
and
the
lid
itself
,
the
recently
rebellious
lid
---
such
be
the
influence
of
a
bright
example
---
perform
a
sort
of
jig
,
and
clatter
like
a
deaf
and
dumb
young
cymbal
that
have
never
know|known
the
use
of
it
twin
brother
.
that
this
song
of
the
kettle
's
be
a
song
of
invitation
and
welcome
to
somebody
out
of
door
:
to
somebody
at
that
moment
come|coming
on
towards
the
snug
small
home
and
the
crisp
fire
:
there
be
no
doubt
whatever
.
mrs.
peerybingle
know
it
perfectly
,
as
she
sit
muse
before
the
hearth
.
it
be
a
dark
night
,
sing
the
kettle
,
and
the
rotten
leaf|leave
be
lie|lying
by
the
way
;
and
,
above
,
all
be
mist
and
darkness
,
and
,
below
,
all
be
mire
and
clay
;
and
there
be
only
one
relief
in
all
the
sad
and
murky
air
;
and
i
do
not
know
that
it
be
one
,
for
it
be
nothing
but
a
glare
;
of
deep
and
angry
crimson
,
where
the
sun
and
wind
together
;
set
a
brand
upon
the
cloud
for
be
guilty
of
such
weather
;
and
the
wide
open
country
be
a
long
dull
streak
of
black
;
and
there
be
hoar
frost
on
the
finger-post
,
and
thaw
upon
the
track
;
and
the
ice
it
be
not
water
,
and
the
water
be
not
free
;
and
you
could
not
say
that
anything
be
what
it
ought
to
be
;
but
he
be
come|coming
,
come|coming
,
come|coming
!
---
and
here
,
if
you
like
,
the
cricket
do
chime
in
!
with
a
chirrup
,
Chirrup
,
chirrup
of
such
magnitude
,
by
way
of
chorus
;
with
a
voice
so
astoundingly
disproportionate
to
it
size
,
as
compare
with
the
kettle
;
(
size
!
you
could
not
see
it
!
)
that
,
if
it
have
then
and
there
burst
itself
like
an
overcharged
gun
,
if
it
have
[

fall|fallen
a
victim
on
the
spot
,
and
chirrupe
it
little
body
into
fifty
piece
,
it
would
have
seem
a
natural
and
inevitable
consequence
,
for
which
it
have
expressly
labour|laboured

the

have
have
the
last
of
it

it

with
undiminished

;
but
the
cricket
take
first
fiddle
,
and
keep
it
.
good
heaven
,
how
it
chirp
!
it
shrill
,
sharp
,
piercing|pierce
voice
resound
through
the
house
,
and
seem
to
twinkle
in
the
outer
darkness
like
a
star
.
there
be
an
indescribable
little

it

yet
they
go
very
well
together
,
the
cricket
and
the
kettle
.
the
burden
of
the
song
be
still
the

;
and

they

that

in

she

be
very
gentle
,
for
he
merely

,
to

it
prove
effectual
,
for
she
stop|stopped

there
be
an

agitation

even
in

may
utter
no

good

with

the

that

,
and
bygone

,
and
that
,
so
long
as
young
people
be
young
and
thoughtless
,
they
would
probably
conduct
themselves
like
young
and
thoughtless
person
:
with
two
or
three
other
position
of
a
no

sound
and
incontrovertible
character
.
she
then
remark
,
in
a
devout
spirit
,
that
she
thank
heaven
she
have
always
find
in
she
daughter
may
a
dutiful
and
obedient
child
:
for
which
she
take
no
credit
to
herself
,
though
she
have
every
reason
to
believe
it
be
entirely
owe|owing
to

with

to
mr.

she
say|said
,
that

no

in

sense

(
she
be

emphatic
here

with

to
the

into

he
be
so
soon
about

after
some
solicitation

to
be
admit|admitted
,
she
believe
mr.

know
that

,
it
have
some
pretension
to
gentility
;
and
that

she
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
with
the
indigo
trade

to
which
she
would
not
more

refer
,
have
happen
differently
,
it
might

have
be
in
possession

she
then
remark
that

would
not
mention
that

reject|rejected
the

that

a

finally
,
she
deliver
it
as
the
general

,
that
those

she
conclude
by
inform|informing
the
company
that
to-morrow

the
day
she
have

that
,
when

for
what
be
she

oh

a
nobody

would
forget
that
such
a
being
live
,

would
take

course

sarcastic
mood

one
