he
have
rise
,
as
he

have
before
he
,
in
the
course
of
life
and
death
,
from
son
to
dombey
,
and
for
nearly
twenty
year
have
be
the
sole
representative
of
the
firm
.
of

have

some
say|said
,
to
a

,
and
who
be
content
to
bind
she
broken|break
spirit
to
the
dutiful
and
meek
endurance
of
the
present
.
such
idle
talk
be
little
likely
to
reach
the
ear
of
mr
dombey
,
whom
it
nearly
concerned|concern

and
probably
no

in

world
would
have
receive|received
it
with
such
utter
incredulity
as
he
,
if

dombey
and

have
often
deal
in

,
but
never
in

.
they
leave|left
that
fancy
ware
to
boy
and
girl
,
and
boarding-school
and
book
.
mr
dombey
would
have
reason
:
that
a
matrimonial
alliance
with
himself
must
,
in
the
nature
of
thing
,
be
gratifying|gratify
and
honourable
to
any
woman
of
common
sense
.
that
the
hope
of
give|giving
birth
to
a
new
partner
in
such
a
house
,
could
not
fail
to
awaken
a
glorious
and
stirring|stir
ambition
in
the
breast
of
the
least
ambitious
of
she
sex
.
that
mrs
dombey
have
enter
on
that
social
contract
of
matrimony
:
almost
necessarily
part
of
a
genteel
and
wealthy
station
,
even
without
reference
to
the
perpetuation
of
family
firm
:
with
she
eye
fully
open
to
these
advantage
.
that
mrs
dombey
have
have
daily
practical
knowledge
of
he
position
in
society
.
that
mrs
dombey
have
always
sit
at
the
head
of
he
table
,
and
do
the
honour
of
he
house
in
a
remarkably
lady-like
and
become|becoming
manner
.
that
mrs
dombey
must
have
be
happy
.
that
she
could
not
help
it
.
or
,
at
all
event
,
with
one
drawback
.
yes
.
that
he
would
have
allow

with
only
one
;
but
that
one
certainly
involve
much

with
the
drawback
of

that
hope
deferred|defer
,
which
,
(
as
the
scripture
very
correctly
tell
we
,
mr
dombey
would
have
add|added
in
a
patronising|patronise
way
;
for
he
high
distinct
idea

of

,

that
as

of
a
general
whole
,
of
which
dombey
and

form
another
part
,
it
be
therefore
to
be
commend|commended
and
upheld
)

the
heart
sick
.
they
have
be

year
,
and
until
this
present
day
on
which
mr

side
of

no

to
speak
of
;
none
worth

six

before

in

but
what
be
a
girl
to
dombey
and

!
in
the
capital
of

merely

coin
that

mr
dombey

cup
of
satisfaction

so
full
at

however
,
that

even
to

on

keenly
at

cravat
,
which
,
with
a

of

loud

,

she

,

at

remote
period
of

,
into
a
fashionable
neighbourhood
at
the
west
end
of
the

,
where
it
stand
in
the
shade
like
a
poor
relation
of
the
great
street
round
the
corner
,
coldly
look
down
upon
by
mighty
mansion
.
it
be
not
exactly
in

court
,
and
it
be
not
exactly
in
a
yard
;
but
it
be
in
the
dull
of
No-Thoroughfares
,
render
anxious
and
haggard
by

.
the

but
it
have
never

;
and
on

often
count

there

another

and

indeed
,
there
be
a
smack
of
stabling
in
the
air
of
princess

;
and
miss

from

what

there

that

in
short
,
with
miss

and
the
blue-faced
major
,
it
be
enough
for
princess

---
as
with

very
small
fragment

it
be
enough
for

'
after
such
a
declaration
,

;

would
deepen
into

notwithstanding

liberal
laudation

it
may
be
doubt
whether
there

perhaps
a
good
expression

it

be

he
have
settle|settled
,
within

that
the

the

if

off

as
in

,
he
would
have

but
as

he

in

now

what

some

we
that

'
mr
dombey
's
young
child
be
,
from
the
beginning|begin
,
so
distinctly
important
to
he
as
a
part
of
he
own
greatness
,
or
(
which
be
the
same
thing
)
of
the
greatness
of
dombey
and
son
,
that
there
be
no
doubt
he
parental
affection
might
have
be
easily
trace
,
like
many
a
goodly
superstructure
of
fair
fame
,
to
a
very
low
foundation
.
but
he
love|loved
he
son
with
all
the
love

have
.
if
there
be
a

frosty
heart

he
son
occupy|occupied

;
if
it
very
hard
surface
could
receive
the
impression

the
image
of
that
son
be
there
;
though
not
so
much
as
an
infant
,
or
as
a
boy
,
but
as
a
grow
man
---
the
'
son
'
of
the
firm
.
therefore
he
be
impatient
to
advance
into
the
future
,
and
to
hurry
over
the
intervening|intervene
passage
of
he
history
.
therefore
he
have

about
they

in

love
;
feel|feeling
as
if
the

thus
paul
grow
to
be
nearly
five
year

.
he
be
a
pretty
little
fellow
;
though
there
be
something
wan
and
wistful
in
he
small
face
,
that
give
occasion
to
many
significant
shake
of
mrs
Wickam
's
head
,
and
many

mrs
Wickam
's
breath

he
temper
give
abundant
promise
of
be
imperious
in
after-life
;
and
he
have
as
hopeful
an
apprehension
of
he
own
importance
,
and
the
rightful
subservience
of
all
other
thing
and
person
to
it
,
as
heart
could
desire
.
he
be
childish
and
sportive
enough
at
time
,
and
not
of
a
sullen
disposition
;
but
he
have
a
strange
,
old-
fashion

thoughtful
way
,
at
other
time
,
of
sit|sitting
brooding|brood
in
he
miniature
arm-chair
,
when
he
look
(
and
talk
)
like
one
of

terrible
little

fairy

,
who
,
at
a
hundred

fifty
or
two
hundred
year
of
age
,
fantastically
represent
the
child
for
whom
they
have

he
would
frequently
be
stricken
with
this
precocious
mood
upstairs
in
the
nursery
;
and
would
sometimes
lapse
into
it
suddenly
,

appear
to

something

that
have
long
flutter
among

,

expressive
of

on

it
excite|excited
he
so
much
,
that
on

as

he
would
roar

however

:
and
walter
would
have
find
it
difficult
to
decide
this
point
.
he
have
a
great
affection
for
the
wharf
where
he
have
encounter
florence
,
and
for
the
street
(
albeit
not

in

by

they
have
come

,
sit|sitting

parlour
of
an
evening
,
he
have
draw
a
whole
gallery
of
fancy
portrait
of
good
mrs
brown
.
it
may
be
that
he
become
a
little
smart
in
he
dress
after
that
memorable
occasion
;
and
he
certainly
like|liked
in
he
leisure

to
walk
towards

quarter

town
where
mr
dombey
's
house
be
situate
,
on
the
vague
chance
of
pass|passing
little
florence
in
the
street
.
but
the
sentiment
of
all
this
be
as
boyish
and
innocent
as
could
be
.
florence
be
very
pretty
,
and
it
be
pleasant
to
admire
a
pretty
face
.
florence
be
defenceless
and
weak
,
and
it
be
a
proud
thought
that
he
have
be
able
to
render
she
any
protection

assistance

florence
be
the
most
grateful
little
creature
in

it
be

to
see

bright
gratitude
beaming|beam

florence
be
neglect|neglected

coldly

,
and
he
breast

full
of
youthful
interest
for
the
slighted|slight
child

dull
,
stately
home
.
thus
it
come
about
that
,
perhaps
some
half-a-dozen
time
in

year

walter
pull|pulled
off

they
set
off
florence
very
much
,
to
he
fancy
;
but
not
himself

sometimes
he
think
(
and
then
he
walk
very
fast
)
what
a
grand
thing
it
would
have
be
for
he
to
have

bear|borne
she
away

these

,

he
withdraw

:
resolve
that
paul
,
now
that
he
be

so
old
and
well
,
should
begin
a
vigorous
course
of
education
forthwith
,
to
qualify
he
for
the
position
in
which
he
be
to
shine
;
and
that
doctor
blimber
should
take
he
in
hand
immediately
.
whenever
a
young
gentleman
be
take|taken
in
hand
by
doctor
blimber

he
might
consider
himself
sure
of
a
pretty
tight

the

only
undertake
the
charge

ten
young
gentleman
,

he
have

always
ready
,
a
supply
of
learning|learn
for
a
hundred
,
on
the
low
estimate
;
and
it
be
at
once
the
business
and
delight
of
he
life
to
gorge
the
unhappy
ten
with
it
.
in
fact
,
doctor
blimber
's
establishment
be
a
great
hot-house
,
in

there
be
a
forcing
apparatus
incessantly
at

this
be
all

but
the

attend
with
it
usual
disadvantage
.
there
be
not
the
right
taste
about
the
premature
production
,
and
they
do
not

moreover
,
one
young

with

swollen|swell

large

suddenly
leave|left

remain
in

there

at

wonder
how

the
crease
.
he
have

Insomuch
,
that

breast

coat
,

with

so
numerous

be
the

little
and
little
it
sink
on
mr
toots
's
knee
,
and
rest
there
,
as
if
it
have
no
care
to
be
ever
lift
up
again
.
that
be
no
reason
why
he
should
be
deaf
;
but
he
must
have
be
,
he
think
,
for
,
by
and
by
,
he
hear
mr
feeder
call|calling
in
he
ear
,
and
gently
shake|shaking
he
to
rouse
he
attention
.
and
when
he
raise|raised
he
head
,
quite
scared|scare
,
and
look
about
he
,
he
find
that
doctor
blimber
have
come
into
the
room
;
and
that
the
window
be
open
,
and
that
he
forehead
be
wet
with
sprinkled
water
;
though
how
all
this
have
be
do
without
he
knowledge
,
be
very
curious
indeed
.
'
ah
!
come
,
come
!
that
be
well
!
how
be
i
little
friend
now
?
'
say|said
doctor
blimber
,
encouragingly
.
'
oh
,
quite
well
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
'
say|said
paul
.
but
there
seem
to
be
something
the
matter
with
the
floor
,
for
he
could
not
stand
upon
it
steadily
;
and
with
the
wall
too
,
for
they
be
inclined|incline
to
turn
round
and
round
,
and
could
only
be
stop|stopped
by
be
look
at
very
hard
indeed
.
mr
toots
's
head
have
the
appearance
of
be
at
once
big
and
farther
off
than
be
quite
natural
;
and
when
he
take
paul
in
he
arm
,
to
carry
he
upstairs
,
paul
observe
with
astonishment
that
the
door
be
in
quite
a
different
place
from
that
in
which
he
have
expect|expected
to
find
it
,
and
almost
think
,
at
first
,
that
mr
toots
be
go|going
to
walk
straight
up
the
chimney
.
it
be
very
kind
of
mr
toots
to
carry
he
to
the
top
of
the
house
so
tenderly
;
and
paul
tell|told
he
that
it
be
.
but
mr
toots
say|said
he
would
do
a
great
deal
more
than
that
,
if
he
could
;
and
indeed
he
do
more
as
it
be
:
for
he
help|helped
paul
to
undress
,
and
help|helped
he
to
bed
,
in
the
kind
manner
possible
,
and
then
sit
down
by
the
bedside
and
chuckle
very
much
;
while
mr
feeder
,
b.a.
,
lean|leaning
over
the
bottom
of
the
bedstead
,
set
all
the
little
bristle
on
he
head
bolt
upright
with
he
bony
hand
,
and
then
make
believe
to
spar
at
paul
with
great
science
,
on
account
of
he
be
all
right
again
,
which
be
so
uncommonly
facetious
,
and
kind
too
in
mr
feeder
,
that
paul
,
not
be
able
to
make
up
he
mind
whether
it
be
good
to
laugh
or
cry
at
he
,
do
both
at
once
.
how
mr
toots
melt
away
,
and
mr
feeder
change|changed
into
mrs
pipchin
,
paul
never
think
of
ask|asking
;
neither
be
he
at
all
curious
to
know
;
but
when
he
see
mrs
pipchin
stand|standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
,
instead
of
mr
feeder
,
he
cry
out
,
'
mrs
pipchin

do
not
tell
florence
!
'
'
do
not

'
say|said
mrs

,
come|coming
round
to
the

,
and
sit|sitting
down
in
the
chair
.
'
about
i
,
'
say|said
paul
.
'
no
,
no

'
say|said
mrs
pipchin
.
'
what
do
you
think
i
mean
to
do
when
i
grow
up
,
mrs

?
'
inquire
paul
,
turn|turning
he
face
towards
she
on
he
pillow
,
and
rest|resting
he
chin
wistfully
on
he
folded|fold
hand
.
mrs
pipchin
could
not
guess
.
'
i
mean
,
'
say|said
paul
,
'
to
put
i
money
all
together
in
one
bank
,
never
try
to
get
any
more
,
go
away
into
the
country
with

darling
florence
,
have
a
beautiful
garden
,
field
,
and
wood
,
and
live
there
with

all
i

!
'
'
indeed
!
'
cry
mrs
pipchin
.
'
yes
,
'
say|said
paul
.
'
that
be
what
i
mean
to
do
,
when
i
---
'
he
stop|stopped
,
and
ponder
for
a
moment
.
mrs
pipchin
's
grey
eye
scan
he
thoughtful
face
.
'
if
i
grow
up
,
'
say|said
paul
.
then
he
go
on
immediately
to
tell
mrs
pipchin
all
about
the
party
,
about
florence
's
invitation
,
about
the
pride
he
would
have
in
the
admiration
that
would
be
feel
for
she
by
all
the
boy
,
about
they
be
so
kind
to
he
and
fond
of
he
,
about
he
be
so
fond
of
they
,
and
about
he
be
so
glad
of
it
.
then
he
tell|told
mrs
pipchin
about
the
analysis
,
and
about
he
be
certainly
old-fashioned
,
and
take
mrs
pipchin
's
opinion
on
that
point
,
and
whether
she
know
why
it
be
,
and
what
it
mean
.
mrs
pipchin
deny
the
fact
altogether
,
as
the
short
way
of
get
out
of
the
difficulty
;
but
paul
be
far
from
satisfied|satisfy
with
that
reply
,
and
look
so
searchingly
at
mrs
pipchin
for
a
true
answer
,
that
she
be
obliged|oblige
to
get
up
and
look
out
of
the
window
to
avoid
he
eye
.
there
be
a
certain
calm
apothecary
,
'
who
attend
at
the
establishment
when
any
of
the
young
gentleman
be
ill
,
and
somehow
he
get
into
the
room
and
appear
at
the
bedside
,
with
mrs
blimber
.
how
they
come
there
,
or
how
long
they
have
be
there
,
paul
do
not
know
;
but
when
he
see
they
,
he
sit
up
in
bed
,
and
answer
all
the
apothecary
's
question
at
full
length
,
and
whisper|whispered
to
he
that
florence
be
not
to
know
anything
about
it
,
if
he
please|pleased
,
and
that
he
have
set

mind
upon
she

to
the
party

he
be
very
chatty
with
the
apothecary
,
and
they
part
excellent
friend
.
lie|lying
down
again
with
he
eye
shut
,
he
hear
the
apothecary
say
,
out
of
the
room
and
quite
a
long
way
off
---
or
he
dream
it
---
that
there
be
a
want
of
vital
power
(
what
be
that
,
paul
wonder
!
)
and
great
constitutional
weakness
.
that
as
the
little
fellow
have
set
he
heart
on
part|parting
with
he
school-mates
on
the
seventeenth
,
it
would
be
good
to
indulge
the
fancy
if
he
grow
no
bad
.
that
he
be
glad
to
hear
from
mrs
pipchin
,
that
the
little
fellow
would
go
to
he
friend
in
london
on
the
eighteenth
.
that
he
would
write
to
mr
dombey
,
when
he
should
have
gain
a
good
knowledge
of
the
case
,
and
before
that
day
.
that
there
be
no
immediate
cause
for
---
what
?
paul
lose|lost
that
word
and
that
the
little
fellow
have
a
fine
mind
,
but
be
an
old-fashioned
boy
.
what
old
fashion
could
that
be
,
paul
wonder
with
a
palpitating|palpitate
heart
,
that
be
so
visibly
express|expressed
in
he
;
so
plainly
see
by
so
many
people
!
he
could
neither
make
it
out
,
nor
trouble
himself
long
with
the
effort
.
mrs
pipchin
be
again
beside
he
,
if
she
have
ever
be
away
(
he
think
she
have
go
out
with
the
doctor
,
but
it
be
all
a
dream
perhaps
)
,
and
presently
a
bottle
and
glass
get
into
she
hand
magically
,
and
she
pour|poured
out
the
content
for
he
.
after
that
,
he
have
some
real
good
jelly
,
which
mrs
blimber
bring
to
he
herself
;
and
then
he
be
so
well
,
that
mrs
pipchin
go
home
,
at
he
urgent
solicitation
,
and
briggs
and
tozer
come
to
bed
.
poor
briggs
grumble
terribly
about
he
own
analysis
,
which
could
hardly
have
discompose
he
more
if
it
have
be
a
chemical
process
;
but
he
be
very
good
to
paul
,
and
so
be
tozer
,
and
so
be
all
the
rest
,
for
they
every
one
look
in
before
go|going
to
bed
,
and
say|said
,
'
how
be
you
now
,
dombey
?
'
'
cheer
up
,
little
dombey
!
'
and
so
forth
.
after
briggs
have
get
into
bed
,
he
lie|lay
awake
for
a
long
time
,
still
bemoan
he
analysis
,
and
say|saying
he
know
it
be
all
wrong
,
and
they
could
not
have
analyse
a
murderer
bad
,
and
---
how
would
doctor
blimber
like
it
if
he
pocket-money
depend
on
it
?
it
be
very
easy
,
briggs
say|said
,
to
make
a
galley-slave
of
a
boy
all
the
half-year
,
and
then
score
he
up
idle
;
and
to
crib
two
dinner
a-week
out
of
he
board
,
and
then
score
he
up
greedy
;
but
that
be
not
go|going
to
be
submit|submitted
to
,
he
believe
,
be
it
?
oh
!
ah
!
before
the
weak-eyed
young
man
perform
on
the
gong
next
morning
,
he
come
upstairs
to
paul
and
tell|told
he
he
be
to
lie
still
,
which
paul
very
gladly
do
.
mrs
pipchin
reappear
a
little
before
the
apothecary
,
and
a
little
after
the
good
young
woman
whom
paul
have
see
clean|cleaning
the
stove
on
that
first
morning
(
how
long
ago
it
seem
now
!
)
have
bring
he
he
breakfast
.
there
be
another
consultation
a
long
way
off
,
or
else
paul
dream
it
again
;
and
then
the
apothecary
,
come|coming
back
with
doctor
and
mrs
blimber
,
say|said
:
'
yes
,
i
think
,
doctor
blimber
,
we
may
release
this
young
gentleman
from

book
just
now
;

so
very
near
at
hand
.
'
'
by
all
means
,
'
say|said
doctor
blimber
.
'
i
love
,
you
will
inform
cornelia
,
if
you
please
.
'
'
assuredly
,
'
say|said
mrs
blimber
.
the
apothecary
bend|bending
down
,
look
closely
into
paul
's
eye
,
and
feel
he
head
,
and
he
pulse
,
and
he
heart
,
with
so
much
interest
and
care
,
that
paul
say|said
,
'
thank
you
,
sir
.
'
'
we
little
friend
,
'
observe
doctor
blimber
,
'
have
never

.
'
'
oh
no
!
'
reply
the
apothecary
.
'
he
be
not
likely
to
complain
.
'
'
you
find
he
greatly
well
?
'
say|said
doctor
blimber
.
'
oh
!
he
be
greatly
good
,
sir
,
'
return
the
apothecary
.
paul
have
begin
to
speculate
,
in
he
own
odd
way
,
on
the
subject
that
might
occupy
the
apothecary
's
mind
just
at
that
moment
;
so
musingly
have
he
answer
the
two
question
of
doctor
blimber
.
but
the
apothecary
happen|happening
to
meet
he
little
patient
's
eye
,
as
the
latter
set
off
on
that
mental
expedition
,
and
come|coming
instantly
out
of
he
abstraction
with
a
cheerful
smile
,
paul
smile
in
return
and
abandon|abandoned
it
.
he
lie|lay
in
bed
all
that
day
,
doze|dozing
and
dream|dreaming
,
and
look|looking
at
mr
toots
;
but
get
up
on
the
next
,
and
go
downstairs
.
lo
and
behold
,
there
be
something
the
matter
with
the
great
clock
;
and
a
workman
on
a
pair
of
step
have
take|taken
it
face
off
,
and
be
poke
instrument
into
the
works
by
the
light
of
a
candle
!
this
be
a
great
event
for
paul
,
who
sit
down
on
the
bottom
stairs
,
and
watch
the
operation
attentively
:
now
and
then
glance
at
the
clock
face
,
lean|leaning
all
askew
,
against
the
wall
hard
by
,
and
feel|feeling
a
little
confused|confuse
by
a
suspicion
that
it
be
ogle
he
.
the
workman
on
the
step
be
very
civil
;
and
as
he
say|said
,
when
he
observe
paul
,
'
how
do
you
do
,
sir
?
'
paul
get
into
conversation
with
he
,
and
tell|told
he
he
have
not
be
quite
well
lately
.
the
ice
be
thus
break|broken
,
paul
ask
he
a
multitude
of
question
about
chime
and
clock
:
as
,
whether
people
watch
up
in
the
lonely
church
steeple
by
night
to
make
they
strike
,
and
how
the
bell
be
ring
when
people
die
,
and
whether
those
be
different
bell
from
wedding
bell
,
or
only
sound
dismal
in
the
fancy
of
the
living|live
.
find|finding
that
he
new
acquaintance
be
not
very
well
inform|informed
on
the
subject
of
the
curfew
bell
of
ancient
day
,
paul
give
he
an
account
of
that
institution
;
and
also
ask
he
,
as
a
practical
man
,
what
he
think
about
king
alfred
's
idea
of
measure|measuring
time
by
the
burning|burn
of
candle
;
to
which
the
workman
reply
,
that
he
think
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
clock
trade
if
it
be
to
come
up
again
.
in
fine
,
paul
look
on
,
until
the
clock
have
quite
recover|recovered
it
familiar
aspect
,
and
resume
it
sedate
inquiry
;
when
the
workman
,
put|putting
away
he
tool
in
a
long
basket
,
bid
he
good
day
,
and
go
away
.
though
not
before
he
have
whisper
something
,
on
the
door-mat
,
to
the
footman
,
in
which
there
be
the
phrase
'
old-fashioned
'
---
for
paul
hear
it
.
what
could
that
old
fashion
be
,
that
seem
to
make
the
people
sorry
!
what
could
it
be
!
have
nothing
to
learn
now
,
he
think
of
this
frequently
;
though
not
so
often
as
he
might
have
do
,
if
he
have
have
fewer
thing
to
think
of
.
but
he
have
a
great
many
;
and
be
always
thinking|think
,
all
day
long
.
first
,
there
be
florence
come|coming
to
the
party
.
florence
would
see
that
the
boy
be
fond
of
he
;
and
that
would
make
she
happy
.
this
be
he
great
theme
.
let
florence
once
be
sure
that
they
be
gentle
and
good
to
he
,
and
that
he
have
become
a
little
favourite
among
they
,
and
then
the
would
always
think
of
the
time
he
have
pass|passed
there
,
without
be
very
sorry
.
florence
might
be
all
the
happy
too
for
that
,
perhaps
,
when
he
come
back
.
when
he
come
back
!
fifty
time
a
day
,
he
noiseless
little
foot
go
up
the
stairs
to
he
own
room
,
as
he
collect|collected
every
book
,
and
scrap
,
and
trifle
that
belong
to
he
,
and
put
they
all
together
there
,
down
to
the
minute
thing
,
for
take|taking
home
!
there
be
no
shade
of
come|coming
back
on
little
paul
;
no
preparation
for
it
,
or
other
reference
to
it
,
grow
out
of
anything
he
think
or
do
,
except
this
slight
one
in
connexion
with
he
sister
.
on
the
contrary
,
he
have
to
think
of
everything
familiar
to
he
,
in
he
contemplative
mood
and
in
he
wandering
about
the
house
,
as
be
to
be
part
with
;
and
hence
the
many
thing
he
have
to
think
of
,
all
day
long
.
he
have
to
peep
into
those
room
upstairs
,
and
think
how
solitary
they
would
be
when
he
be
go
,
and
wonder
through
how
many
silent
day
,
week
,
month
,
and
year
,
they
would
continue
just
as
grave
and
undisturbed
.
he
have
to
think
---
would
any
other
child
(
old-fashioned
,
like
himself
)
stray
there
at
any
time
,
to
whom
the
same
grotesque
distortion
of
pattern
and
furniture
would
manifest
themselves
;
and
would
anybody
tell
that
boy
of
little
dombey
,
who
have
be
there
once
?
he
have
to
think
of
a
portrait
on
the
stairs
,
which
always
look
earnestly
after
he
as
he
go
away
,
eye
it
over
he
shoulder
;
and
which
,
when
he
pass|passed
it
in
the
company
of
anyone
,
still
seem
to
gaze
at
he
,
and
not
at
he
companion
.
he
have
much
to
think
of
,
in
association
with
a
print
that
hang|hung
up
in
another
place
,
where
,
in
the
centre
of
a
wonder
group
,
one
figure
that
he
know
,
a
figure
with
a
light
about
it
head
---
benignant
,
mild
,
and
merciful
---
stand
point|pointing
upward
.
at
he
own
bedroom
window
,
there
be
crowd
of
thought
that
mix
with
these
,
and
come
on
,
one
upon
another
,
like
the
rolling|roll
wave
.
where
those
wild
bird
live
,
that
be
always
hover|hovering
out
at
sea
in
troubled|trouble
weather
;
where
the
cloud
rose
and
first
begin
;
whence
the
wind
issue|issued
on
it
rushing|rush
flight
,
and
where
it
stop|stopped
;
whether
the
spot
where
he
and
florence
have
so
often
sit
,
and
watch
,
and
talk
about
these
thing
,
could
ever
be
exactly
as
it
use|used
to
be
without
they
;
whether
it
could
ever
be
the
same
to
florence
,
if
he
be
in
some
distant
place
,
and
she
be
sit|sitting
there
alone
.
he
have
to
think
,
too
,
of
mr
toots
,
and
mr
feeder
,
b.a.
,
of
all
the
boy
;
and
of
doctor
blimber
,
mrs
blimber
,
and
miss
blimber
;
of
home
,
and
of
he
aunt
and
miss
tox
;
of
he
father
;
dombey
and
son
,
walter
with
the
poor
old
uncle
who
have
get
the
money
he
want|wanted
,
and
that
gruff-voiced
captain
with
the
iron
hand
.
besides
all
this
,
he
have
a
number
of
little
visit
to
pay
,
in
the
course
of
the
day
;
to
the
schoolroom
,
to
doctor
blimber
's
study
,
to
mrs
blimber
's
private
apartment
,
to
miss
blimber
's
,
and
to
the
dog
.
for
he
be
free
of
the
whole
house
now
,
to
range
it
as
he
choose
;
and
,
in
he
desire
to
part
with
everybody
on
affectionate
term
,
he
attend
,
in
he
way
,
to
they
all
.
sometimes
he
find
place
in
book
for
briggs
,
who
be
always
lose|losing
they
;
sometimes
he
look
up
word
in
dictionary
for
other
young
gentleman
who
be
in
extremity
;
sometimes
he
hold|held
skein
of
silk
for
mrs
blimber
to
wind
;
sometimes
he
put
cornelia
's
desk
to
right
;
sometimes
he
would
even
creep
into
the
doctor
's
study
,
and
,
sit|sitting
on
the
carpet
near
he
learned|learn
foot
,
turn
the
globe
softly
,
and
go
round
the
world
,
or
take
a
flight
among
the
far-off
star
.
in
those
day
immediately
before
the
holiday
,
in
short
,
when
the
other
young
gentleman
be
labour|labouring
for
dear
life
through
a
general
resumption
of
the
study
of
the
whole
half-year
,
paul
be
such
a
privileged|privilege
pupil
as
have
never
be
see
in
that
house
before
.
he
could
hardly
believe
it
himself
;
but
he
liberty
last
from
hour
to
hour
,
and
from
day
to
day
;
and
little
dombey
be
caress
by
everyone
.
doctor
blimber
be
so
particular
about
he
,
that
he
request
johnson
to
retire
from
the
dinner-table
one
day
,
for
have
thoughtlessly
speak|spoken
to
he
as
'
poor
little
dombey
;
'
which
paul
think
rather
hard
and
severe
,
though
he
have
flush|flushed
at
the
moment
,
and
wonder
why
johnson
should
pity
he
.
it
be
the
more
questionable
justice
,
paul
think
,
in
the
doctor
,
from
he
have
certainly
overhear
that
great
authority
give
he
assent
on
the
previous
evening
,
to
the
proposition
(
state|stated
by
mrs
blimber
)
that
poor
dear
little
dombey
be
more
old-fashioned
than
ever
.
and
now
it
be
that
paul
begin
to
think
it
must
surely
be
old-fashioned
to
be
very
thin
,
and
light
,
and
easily
tired|tire
,
and
soon
dispose|disposed
to
lie
down
anywhere
and
rest
;
for
he
could
not
help
feel|feeling
that
these
be
more
and
more
he
habit
every
day
.
at
last
the
party-day
arrive
;
and
doctor
blimber
say|said
at
breakfast
,
'
gentleman
,
we
will
resume
we
study
on
the
twenty-fifth
of
next
month
.
'
mr
toots
immediately
throw|threw
off
he
allegiance
,
and
put
on
he
ring
:
and
mention|mentioning
the
doctor
in
casual
conversation
shortly
afterwards
,
speak
of
he
as
'
blimber
'
!
this
act
of
freedom
inspire|inspired
the
old
pupil
with
admiration
and
envy
;
but
the
young
spirit
be
appalled|appal
,
and
seem
to
marvel
that
no
beam
fall|fell
down
and
crushed|crush
he
.
not
the
least
allusion
be
make
to
the
ceremony
of
the
evening
,
either
at
breakfast
or
at
dinner
;
but
there
be
a
bustle
in
the
house
all
day
,
and
in
the
course
of
he
perambulation
,
paul
make
acquaintance
with
various
strange
bench
and
candlestick
,
and
meet
a
harp
in
a
green
greatcoat
stand|standing
on
the
landing|land
outside
the
drawing-room
door
.
there
be
something
queer
,
too
,
about
mrs
blimber
's
head
at
dinner-time
,
as
if
she
have
screw
she
hair
up
too
tight
;
and
though
miss
blimber
show
a
graceful
bunch
of
plaited|plait
hair
on
each
temple
,
she
seem
to
have
she
own
little
curl
in
paper
underneath
,
and
in
a
play-bill
too
;
for
paul
read
'
theatre
royal
'
over
one
of
she
sparkle|sparkling
spectacle
,
and
'
brighton
'
over
the
other
.
there
be
a
grand
array
of
white
waistcoat
and
cravat
in
the
young
gentleman
's
bedroom
as
evening
approach|approached
;
and
such
a
smell
of
singed|singe
hair
,
that
doctor
blimber
send
up
the
footman
with
he
compliment
,
and
wish|wished
to
know
if
the
house
be
on
fire
.
but
it
be
only
the
hairdresser
curl|curling
the
young
gentleman
,
and
over-heat
he
tong
in
the
ardour
of
business
.
when
paul
be
dress|dressed
---
which
be
very
soon
do
,
for
he
feel
unwell
and
drowsy
,
and
be
not
able
to
stand
about
it
very
long
---
he
go
down
into
the
drawing-room
;
where
he
find
doctor
blimber
pace
up
and
down
the
room
full
dress|dressed
,
but
with
a
dignified
and
unconcerned
demeanour
,
as
if
he
think
it
barely
possible
that
one
or
two
people
might
drop
in
by
and
by
.
shortly
afterwards
,
mrs
blimber
appear
,
look|looking
lovely
,
paul
think
;
and
attire
in
such
a
number
of
skirt
that
it
be
quite
an
excursion
to
walk
round
she
.
miss
blimber
come
down
soon
after
she
mama
;
a
little
squeeze|squeezed
in
appearance
,
but
very
charming
.
mr
toots
and
mr
feeder
be
the
next
arrival
.
each
of
these
gentleman
bring
he
hat
in
he
hand
,
as
if
he
live
somewhere
else
;
and
when
they
be
announce|announced
by
the
butler
,
doctor
blimber
say|said
,
'
ay
,
ay
,
ay
!
god
bless
i
soul
!
'
and
seem
extremely
glad
to
see
they
.
mr
toots
be
one
blaze
of
jewellery
and
button
;
and
he
feel
the
circumstance
so
strongly
,
that
when
he
have
shake|shaken
hand
with
the
doctor
,
and
have
bow
to
mrs
blimber
and
miss
blimber
,
he
take
paul
aside
,
and
say|said
,
'
what
do
you
think
of
this
,
dombey
?
'
but
notwithstanding
this
modest
confidence
in
himself
,
mr
toots
appear
to
be
involve|involved
in
a
good
deal
of
uncertainty
whether
,
on
the
whole
,
it
be
judicious
to
button
the
bottom
button
of
he
waistcoat
,
and
whether
,
on
a
calm
revision
of
all
the
circumstance
,
it
be
good
to
wear
he
waistband
turn|turned
up
or
turn|turned
down
.
observe
that
mr
feeder
's
be
turn
up
,
mr
toots
turn|turned
his
up
;
but
the
waistband
of
the
next
arrival
be
turn
down
,
mr
toots

his
down
.
the
difference
in
point
of
waistcoat-buttoning
,
not
only
at
the
bottom
,
but
at
the
top
too
,
become
so
numerous
and
complicated|complicate
as
the
arrival
thicken
,
that
mr
toots
be
continually
finger
that
article
of

,
as
if
he
be
perform|performing
on
some
instrument
;
and
appear
to
find
the
incessant

quite
bewildering

all

and
condescending

,
with

and
measured|measure
manner
of
speak|speaking
;
and
before
he
have
stand
under
the
lamp
five
minute
,
he
begin
to
talk
to

(
who
have
be
silently

about
what

'

nor
why
the
two

nor

to
paul
to
be
particularly
happy
,
or
particularly
anything
but
sulky
,
or
to
care
much
what
he
be
about
;
but
as
paul
hear
lady
Skettles
say
to
mrs
blimber
,
while
she
beat
time
with
she
fan
,
that
she
dear
boy
be
evidently
smite
to
death
by
that
angel
of
a
child
,
miss
dombey
,
it
would
seem
that
Skettles
junior
be
in
a
state
of
bliss
,
without
show|showing
it
.
little
paul
think
it
a
singular
coincidence
that
nobody
have
occupy|occupied
he
place
among
the
pillow
;
and
that
when
he
come
into
the
room
again
,
they
should
all
make
way
for
he
to
go
back
to
it
,
remember|remembering
it
be
his
.
nobody
stand
before
he
either
,
when
they
observe
that
he
like|liked
to
see
florence
dancing|dance
,
but
they
leave|left
the
space
in
front
quite
clear
,
so
that
he
might
follow
she
with
he
eye
.
they
be
so
kind
,
too
,
even
the
stranger
,
of
whom
there
be
soon
a
great
many
,
that
they
come
and
speak
to
he
every
now
and
then
,
and
ask
he
how
he
be
,
and
if
he
head
ache
,
and
whether
he
be
tired|tire
.
he
be
very
much
obliged|oblige
to
they
for
all
they
kindness
and
attention
,
and
recline|reclining
prop
up
in
he
corner
,
with
mrs
blimber
and
lady
Skettles
on
the
same
sofa
,
and
florence
come|coming
and
sit|sitting
by
he
side
as
soon
as
every
dance
be
end
,
he
look
on
very
happily
indeed
.
florence
would
have
sit
by
he
all
night
,
and
would
not
have
dance
at
all
of
she
own
accord
,
but
paul
make
she
,
by
tell|telling
she
how
much
it
please|pleased
he
.
and
he
tell|told
she
the
truth
,
too
;
for
he
small
heart
swell
,
and
he
face
glow
,
when
he
see
how
much
they
all
admire
she
,
and
how
she
be
the
beautiful
little
rosebud
of
the
room
.
from
he
nest
among
the
pillow
,
paul
could
see
and
hear
almost
everything
that
pass|passed
as
if
the
whole
be
be
do
for
he
amusement
.
among
other
little
incident
that
he
observe
,
he
observe
mr
Baps
the
dancing-master
get
into
conversation
with
sir
barnet
Skettles
,
and
very
soon
ask
he
,
as
he
have
ask
mr
toots
,
what
you
be
to
do
with
you
raw
material
,
when
they
come
into
you
port
in
return
for
you
drain
of
gold
---
which
be
such
a
mystery
to
paul
that
he
be
quite
desirous
to
know
what
ought
to
be
do
with
they
.
sir
barnet
Skettles
have
much
to
say
upon
the
question
,
and
say|said
it
;
but
it
do
not
appear
to
solve
the
question
,
for
mr
Baps
retort
,
yes
,
but
supposing
russia
step|stepped
in
with
she
tallows
;
which
strike
sir
barnet
almost
dumb
,
for
he
could
only
shake
he
head
after
that
,
and
say
,
why
then
you
must
fall
back
upon
you
cotton
,
he
suppose
.
sir
barnet
Skettles
look
after
mr
Baps
when
he
go
to
cheer
up
mrs
Baps
(
who
,
be
quite
desert|deserted
,
be
pretend
to
look
over
the
music-book
of
the
gentleman
who
play
the
harp
)
,
as
if
he
think
he
a
remarkable
kind
of
man
;
and
shortly
afterwards
he
say|said
so
in
those
word
to
doctor
blimber
,
and
inquire
if
he
might
take
the
liberty
of
ask|asking
who
he
be
,
and
whether
he
have
ever
be
in
the
board
of
trade
.
doctor
blimber
answer
no
,
he
believe
not
;
and
that
in

he
be
a
professor
of

'
of

.
'
why
yes
,
'
say|said
doctor
blimber
,
yes
,
but
not
of
that
sort
.
mr
Baps
be
a
very
worthy
sort
of
man
,
sir
barnet
,
and
---
in
fact
he
be
we
professor
of
dancing|dance
.
'
paul
be
amazed|amaze
to
see
that
this
piece
of
information
quite
alter|altered
sir
barnet
Skettles
's
opinion
of
mr
Baps
,
and
that
sir
barnet
fly
into
a
perfect
rage
,
and
glower
at
mr
Baps
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
he
even
go
so
far
as
to
d
mr
Baps
to
lady
Skettles
,
in
tell|telling
she
what
have
happen
,
and
to
say
that
it
be
like
he

.
there
be
another
thing
that
paul
observe
.
mr

,
after
imbibe
several
custard-cups
of
negus
,
begin
to
enjoy
himself
.
the
dancing|dance
in
general
be
ceremonious
,
and
the
music
rather
solemn
---
a
little
like
church
music
in
fact
---
but
after
the
custard-cups
,
mr
feeder
tell|told
mr
toots
that
he
be
go|going
to
throw
a
little
spirit
into
the
thing
.
after
that
,
mr
feeder
not
only
begin
to
dance
as
if
he
mean
dance|dancing
and
nothing
else
,
but
secretly
to
stimulate
the
music
to
perform
wild
tune
.
further/far
,
he
become
particular
in
he
attention
to
the
lady
;
and
dance|dancing
with
miss
blimber
,
whisper|whispered
to
she
---

---
though
not
so
softly

that

,
'

'
this
,
paul
hear
he
repeat
to
four
young
lady
,
in

.
well
might
mr
feeder
say
to
mr
toots
,
that
he
be
afraid
he
should
be
the
bad
for
it
to-morrow
!
mrs

be
a
little
alarmed|alarm
by
this
---
comparatively

profligate
behaviour
;
and
especially
by
the
alteration

the
character

,
which
,

that
be

,
might
not

Skettles

but
lady
Skettles
be
so
very
kind
as
to
beg
mrs

it
;

to
receive
she

that
mr

with

that

which
(
as
already
hint
)
be
about
a

once
,
when

seem
very
fond

when

amazing|amaze
artfulness
of
captain
cuttle
,
and
a
new
pursuit
for
walter
gay
walter
could
not
,
for
several
day
,
decide
what
to
do
in
the
barbados
business
;
and
even
cherish
some
faint
hope
that
mr
dombey
might
not
have
mean
what
he
have
say
,
or
that
he
might
change
he
mind
,
and
tell
he
he
be
not
to
go
.
but
as
nothing
occur
to
give
this
idea
(
which
be
sufficiently
improbable
in
itself
)
any
touch
of
confirmation
,
and
as
time
be
slip|slipping
by
,
and
he
have
none
to
lose
,
he
feel
that
he
must
act
,
without
hesitate
any
longer
.
walter
's
chief
difficulty
be
,
how
to
break
the
change
in
he
affair
to
uncle
sol
,
to
whom
he
be
sensible
it
would
be

blow

he
have
the
great
difficulty
in
dashing|dash
uncle
sol
's
spirit
with
such
an
astounding|astound
piece
of
intelligence
,
because
they
have
lately
recover|recovered
very
much
,
and
the
old
man
have
become
so
cheerful
,
that
the
little
back
parlour
be
itself
again
.
uncle
sol
have
pay|paid
the
first
appoint|appointed
portion
of
the
debt
to
mr
dombey
,
and
be
hopeful
of
work|working
he
way
through
the
rest
;
and
to
cast
he
down
afresh
,
when
he
have
spring
up
so
manfully
from
he
trouble
,
be
a
very
distressing
necessity
.
yet
it
would
never
do
to
run
away
from
he
.
he
must
know
of
it
beforehand
;
and
how
to
tell
he
be
the
point
.
as
to
the
question
of
go|going
or
not
go|going
,
walter
do
not
consider
that
he
have
any
power
of
choice
in
the
matter
.
mr
dombey
have
truly
tell
he
that
he
be
young
,
and
that
he
uncle
's
circumstance
be
not
good
;
and
mr
dombey
have
plainly
express|expressed
,
in
the
glance
with
which
he
have
accompany
that
reminder
,
that
if
he
decline
to
go
he
might
stay
at
home
if
he
choose
,
but
not
in
he
counting-house
.
he
uncle
and
he
lie|lay
under
a
great
obligation
to
mr
dombey
,
which
be
of
walter
's
own
soliciting|solicit
.
he
might
have
begin
in
secret
to
despair
of
ever
win|winning
that
gentleman
's
favour
,
and
might
have
think
that
he
be
now
and
then
dispose|disposed
to
put
a
slight
upon
he
,
which
be
hardly
just
.
but
what
would
have
be
duty
without
that
,
be
still
duty
with
it
---
or
walter
think
so
---
and
duty
must
be

.
when
mr
dombey
have

at
he
,
and
tell|told
he
he
be
young
,
and
that
he
uncle
's
circumstance
be
not
good
,
there
have
be
an
expression
of
disdain
in
he
face
;
a
contemptuous
and
disparaging
assumption
that
he
would
be
quite
content
to
live
idly
on
a
reduced|reduce

man
,
which

soul

determine|determined
to
assure
mr

,
in
so
far
as
it
be
possible
to
give
he
the
assurance

it
in

,
that
indeed
he
mistake
he
nature
,
walter
have
be
anxious
to
show
even
more
cheerfulness
and
activity
after
the
west
indian
interview
than
he
have
show
before
:
if
that
be
possible
,
in
one
of

quick
and
zealous
disposition

he
be
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
think
,
that
possibly
this
very
quality
in
he
be
not
agreeable
to
mr

,
and
that
it
be
no

elastic

it

by
degree
it

it

one
fact
be

clear
to

as

,
sit|sitting

untasted
dinner

dwell
on

that

modesty
might
stand
in

way

himself
,
he
be
,
as

a

it

for

gain

that
he
have
no

such
an
investment
would
yield
a
handsome
premium
.

and
have

the

would
come
down
to

hall
,
and
put
she
hand
in

,
and
lead
he
up
the

;
and
florence
would
see
she
afterwards
sit|sitting
by
he
side
,
or
on
he
knee
,
or
hang|hanging
coaxingly
about
he
neck
and
talk|talking
to
he
:
and
though
they
be
always

together
,
he
would
often
watch

she
like
she
mother
that

dead
.
florence
would
sometimes

at

burst|bursting
into
tear
would
hide
behind

as
if

be
frightened|frighten
,
or
would
hurry
from

yet
she
could
not

and
she

would
soon

from

again
.
it
be
the
house
that
have
be
empty
,
year
ago
.
it
have
remain
so
for
a
long
time

at
last
,

;
and
there

bird
and
flower
about

;
and
it
look
very
different
from

but
she
never

.
the

and
they

be
all
in

.
when
he
have

,
she
could
see
they
,
through
the
open
window
,
go
down
with
they
governess
or
nurse
,
and
cluster
round
the
table
;
and
in
the
still
summer
weather
,
the
sound
of
they
childish
voice
and
clear
laughter
would
come
ring|ringing
across
the
street
,
into
the
drooping|droop
air
of
the
room
in
which
she
sit
.
then
they
would
climb
and
clamber
upstairs
with
he
,
and
romp
about
he
on
the
sofa
,
or
group
themselves
at
he
knee
,
a
very
nosegay
of
little
face
,
while
he
seem
to
tell
they
some
story
.
or
they
would
come
run|running
out
into
the
balcony
;
and
then
florence
would
hide
herself
quickly
,
lest
it
should
check
they
in
they
joy
,
to
see
she
in
she
black
dress
,
sit|sitting
there
alone
.
the
elder

remain
with
she

when
the

go
away
,
and
make
he
tea
for
he
---
happy
little
house-keeper

be
then
!
---
and
sit
converse
with
he
,
sometimes
at
the
window
,
sometimes
in
the
room
,
until
the
candle
come
.
he
make
she
he
companion
,
though
she
be
some
year
young
than
florence
;
and
she
could
be
as
staid
and
pleasantly
demure
,
with
she
little
book
or
work-box
,
as
a
woman
.
when
they
have
candle
,
florence
from
she
own
dark
room
be
not
afraid
to
look
again
.
but
when
the
time
come
for
the
child
to
say
'
good-night
,
papa
,
'
and
go
to
bed
,
florence
would
sob
and
tremble
as
she
raise|raised
she
face
to
he
,
and
could
look
no
more
.
though
still
she
would
turn
,
again
and
again
,
before
go|going
to
bed
herself
from
the
simple
air
that
have
lull
he
to
rest
so
often
,
long
ago
,
and
from
the
other
low
soft
broken|break
strain
of
music
,
back
to
that
house
.
but
that
she
ever
think
of
it
,
or
watch
it
,
be
a
secret
which
she
keep
within
she
own
young
breast
.
and
do
that
breast
of
florence
---
florence
,
so
ingenuous
and
true
---
so
worthy
of
the
love
that
he
have
bear|borne
she
,
and
have
whisper
in
he
last
faint
word
---
whose
guileless
heart
be
mirror
in
the
beauty
of
she
face
,
and
breathe
in
every
accent
of
she
gentle
voice
---
do
that
young
breast
hold
any

yes

one
more
.
when
no
one
in
the
house
be
stir|stirring
,
and
the
light
be
all

,
she
would
softly
leave
she

,
and
with
noiseless
foot
descend
the
staircase
,
and
approach
she
father
's
door
.
against
it
,
scarcely

she
would

in

she
crouch|crouched

a

no

the

if
there

would
know

,
and
work
out
they
combination
in

mind
after
they
be

nothing
seem
to
do
mr

so
much
good
as
incessantly
leave|leaving
card
at
mr

's
door
.
no
taxgatherer
in

where
the

never

be
more
regular
and
persever|persevering
in
he
call
than
mr

.
mr
toots
never
go
upstairs
;
and
always
perform
the
same
ceremony
,
richly
dress|dressed
for
the
purpose
,
at
the
hall
door
.
'
oh
!
good
morning
!
'
would
be
mr
toots
's
first
remark
to
the
servant
.
'
for
mr
dombey
,
'
would
be
mr
toots
's
next
remark
,
as
he
hand
in
a
card
.
'
for
miss
dombey
,
'
would
be
he
next
,
as
he
hand
in
another
.
mr
toots
would
then
turn
round
as
if
to
go
away
;
but
the
man
know
he
by
this
time
,
and
know
he
would
not
.
'
oh
,
i
beg
you
pardon
,
'
mr
toots
would
say
,
as
if
a
thought
have
suddenly
descend
on
he
.
'
be
the
young
woman
at
home
?
'
the
man
would
rather
think
she
be
,
but
would
not
quite
know
.
then
he
would
ring
a
bell
that
ring
upstairs
,
and
would
look
up
the
staircase
,
and
would
say
,
yes
,
she
be
at
home
,
and
be
come|coming
down
.
then
miss
nipper
would
appear
,
and
the
man
would
retire
.
'
oh
!
how
de
do
?
'
mr
toots
would
say
,
with
a
chuckle
and
a
blush
.
susan
would
thank
he
,
and
say
she
be
very
well
.
'
how
be
diogenes
go|going
on
?
'
would
be
mr
toots
's
second
interrogation
.
very
well
indeed
.
miss
florence
be
fond
and
fond
of
he
every
day
.
mr
toots
be
sure
to
hail
this
with
a
burst
of
chuckle
,
like
the
opening|open
of
a
bottle
of
some
effervescent
beverage
.
'
miss
florence
be
quite
well
,
sir
,
'
susan
would
add
.
oh
,
it
be
of
no
consequence
,
thank'ee
,
'
be
the
invariable
reply
of
mr
toots
;
and
when
he
have
say
so
,
he
always
go
away
very
fast
.
now
it
be
certain
that
mr
toots
have
a
filmy
something
in
he
mind
,
which
lead
he
to
conclude
that
if
he
could
aspire
successfully
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
to
the
hand
of
florence
,
he
would
be
fortunate
and
blest
.
it
be
certain
that
mr
toots
,
by
some
remote
and
roundabout
road
,
have
get
to
that
point
,
and
that
there
he
make
a
stand
.
he
heart
be
wound|wounded
;
he
be
touch|touched
;
he
be
in
love
.
he
have
make
a
desperate
attempt
,
one
night
,
and
have
sit
up
all
night
for
the
purpose
,
to
write
an
acrostic
on
florence
,
which
affect|affected
he
to
tear
in
the
conception
.
but
he
never
proceed
in
the
execution
far
than
the
word
'
for
when
i
gaze
,
'
---
the
flow
of
imagination
in
which
he
have
previously
write|written
down
the
initial
letter
of
the
other
seven
line
,
desert
he
at
that
point
.
beyond
devise
that
very
artful
and
politic
measure
of
leave|leaving
a
card
for
mr
dombey
daily
,
the
brain
of
mr
toots
have
not
work
much
in
reference
to
the
subject
that
hold|held
he
feeling
prisoner
.
but
deep
consideration
at
length
assured|assure
mr
toots
that
an
important
step
to
gain
,
be
,
the
conciliation
of
miss
susan
nipper
,
preparatory
to
give|giving
she
some
inkling
of
he
state
of
mind
.
a
little
light
and
playful
gallantry
towards
this
lady
seem
the
means
to
employ
in
that
early
chapter
of
the
history
,
for
win|winning
she
to
he
interest
.
not
be
able
quite
to
make
up
he
mind
about
it
,
he
consult
the
chicken
---
without
take|taking
that
gentleman
into
he
confidence
;
merely
inform|informing
he
that
a
friend
in
yorkshire
have
write|written
to
he
(
mr
toots
)
for
he
opinion
on
such
a
question
.
the
chicken
reply
that
he
opinion
always
be
,
'
go
in
and
win
,
'
and
further/far|**further/far

'
when

'

consider|considered
this

way
of
supporting|support

own
view
of
the
case
,
and
heroically
resolve|resolved
to
kiss
miss

next

upon
the
next
day
,
therefore
,
mr
toots
,
put|putting
into
requisition
some
of
the
great
marvel
that
burgess
and
co.
have
ever
turn
out
,
go
off

be
upon
this
design
.
but
he
heart
fail|failed

so
much
as
he
approach|approached
the
scene

,
that
,
although
he
arrive
on
the
ground
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
it
be
six
before
he
knock
at
the
door
.
everything
happen
as
usual
,
down
to
the
point
where
susan
say|said
she
young
mistress
be
well
,
and
mr
toots
say|said
it
be
of
no
consequence
.
to
she
amazement
,
mr
toots
,
instead
of
go|going
off
,
like
a
rocket
,
after
that
observation
,
linger
and
chuckle
.
'
perhaps
you
would
like
to
walk
upstairs
,
sir
!
'
say|said
susan
.
'
well
,
i
think
i
will
come
in
!
'
say|said
mr

but
instead
of

upstairs

the
bold
toot
make
an
awkward
plunge
at

when

door
be
shut
,

fair
creature

the

that

away

mr

health
,
observe
,
'
feeder
,
you
have
no
idea
of
the
sentiment
with
which

he
be

by

wildly
out
into

the
watch
of
the
night
florence
,
long
since
awaken
from
she
dream
,
mournfully
observe
the
estrangement
between
she
father
and
edith
,
and
see
it
widen
more
and
more
,
and
know
that
there
be
great
bitterness
between

day

the

,
rouse
up
the
old
sorrow
that
have
slumber
for
a
little
time
,
and
make
it
even
heavy
to
bear
than
it
have
be
before
.
it
have
be
hard
---
how
hard
may
none
but
florence
ever
know
!
---
to
have
the
natural
affection
of
a
true
and
earnest
nature
turn
to
agony
;
and
slight
,
or
stern
repulse
,
substitute
for
the
tendere
protection
and
the
dear
care
.
it
have
be
hard
to
feel
in
she
deep
heart
what
she
have
feel
,
and
never
know
the
happiness
of
one
touch
of
response
.
but
it
be
much
more
hard
to
be
compel
to
doubt
either
she
father
or
edith
,
so
affectionate
and
dear
to
she
,
and
to
think
of
she
love
for
each
of
they
,
by
turn
,
with
fear
,
distrust
,
and
wonder
.
yet
florence
now
begin
to
do
so
;
and
the
doing
of
it
be
a
task
impose|imposed
upon
she
by
the
very
purity
of
she
soul
,
as
one
she
could
not
fly
from
.
she
see
she
father
cold
and
obdurate
to
edith
,
as
to
she
;
hard
,
inflexible
,
unyielding
.
could
it
be
,
she
ask
herself
with
start|starting
tear
,
that
she
own
dear
mother
have
be
make
unhappy
by
such
treatment
,
and
have
pine
away
and
die
?
then
she
would
think
how
proud
and
stately
edith
be
to
everyone
but
she
,
with
what
disdain
she
treat|treated
he
,
how
distantly
she
keep
apart
from
he
,
and
what
she
have
say
on
the
night
when
they
come
home
;
and
quickly
it
would
come
on
florence
,
almost
as
a
crime
,
that
she
love|loved
one
who
be
set
in
opposition
to
she
father
,
and
that
she
father
know|knowing
of
it
,
must
think
of
she
in

as
the
unnatural
child
who
add|added
this

to
the

fault
,
so
much

for
,
of

he

birth
.
the
next
kind
word
from
edith
,
the
next
kind
glance
,
would
shake
these
thought
again
,
and
make
they
seem
like
black
ingratitude
;
for
who
but
she
have
cheer
the
drooping|droop
heart
of
florence
,
so
lonely
and
so
hurt
,
and
be

to

the

how

altogether
.
'
he
sit
for
a
minute

so
,
drum|drumming
with

as
if

confession

'
before
i
know
what
to
do
,

whether
i
could
do
anything
,
there
be
a
second
conversation
between
the

two

,
in
which
they

be
mention

i
have
no
scruple

consider|considered
they
mine

after
that
,
i
come
here
to
see
the
sister
for
myself
.
the
first
time
i
stop|stopped
at
the
garden
gate
,
i
make
a
pretext
of
inquire|inquiring
into
the
character
of
a
poor
neighbour
;

i
wander
out

tract

i

i
.
the
second

in
;

you

i
reason

then
;

remain
unbroken
until

few
day
,

be

,
by
important
matter
that

lately

upon

,
from

they
.
'
'
how
little
i
have
suspect|suspected
this
,
'

john

,
'
when
i
have
see
you
every
day

sir
!
if

could
have
guess

name

'
why
,
to
tell
you
the
truth

john

'
interpose
the

keep
it
to
myself

reason
.
i
do
not

that
the
first
might
have
be
binding|bind
alone
;
but
one
have
no
business
to
take

intention
,

i
make
up

mind
,
at

event
,
not
to
disclose
myself
until
i
should
be
able
to
do
you
some
real
service

other
.
i
second
reason
be
,
that
i
always
hope
there
might
be
some
lingering
possibility
of
you
brother
be
relent
towards
you
both
;
and
in

case
,
i
feel
that
where
there
be
the
chance

suspicious
,
watchful
character

discover
that
you
have
be
secretly

by
i
,
there
be
the
chance

a
new
and
fatal
cause
of
division

i
resolve
,
to
be
sure
,
at
the
risk
of
turn|turning
he
displeasure
against
myself
---
which
would
have
be
no
matter
---
to
watch
i
opportunity

mr

not

hint
at

it
be
a
more
memorable
sight
than
the
unflinching
steadiness
of

lady
,
the
exultation
of
the
short
gentleman
in

the

the
ceremony

by

general
spring

the
young
family
on

whom

hail
by
the
endearing
name

from
whom
they
solicit
half-pence

that
