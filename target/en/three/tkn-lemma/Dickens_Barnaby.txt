preface
the
late
mr
waterton
have
,
some
time
ago
,
express|expressed
the
opinion
that
raven
be
gradually
become|becoming
extinct
in
england
,
i
offer|offered
the
few
following|follow
word
about
i
experience
of
these
bird
.
the
raven
in
this
story
be
a
compound
of
two
great
original
,
of
whom
i
be
,
at
different
time
,
the
proud
possessor
.
the
first
be
in
the
bloom
of
he
youth
,
when
he
be
discover
in
a
modest
retirement
in
london
,
by
a
friend
of
mine
,
and
give|given
to
i
.
he
have
from
the
first
,
as
sir
hugh
evans
say
of
anne
page
,
'
good
gift
'
,
which
he
improve|improved
by
study
and
attention
in
a
most
exemplary
manner
.
he
sleep
in
a
stable
---
generally
on
horseback
---
and
so
terrify
a
newfoundland
dog
by
he
preternatural
sagacity
,
that
he
have
be
know|known
,
by
the
mere
superiority
of
he
genius
,
to
walk
off
unmolested
with
the
dog
's
dinner
,
from
before
he
face
.
he
be
rapidly
rise|rising
in
acquirement
and
virtue
,
when
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
he
stable
be
newly
paint|painted
.
he
observe
the
workman
closely
,
see
that
they
be
careful
of
the
paint
,
and
immediately
burn|burned
to
possess
it
.
on
they
go|going
to
dinner
,
he
eat
up
all
they
have
leave|left
behind
,
consist
of
a
pound
or
two
of
white
lead
;
and
this
youthful
indiscretion
terminate|terminated
in
death
.
while
i
be
yet
inconsolable
for
he
loss
,
another
friend
of
mine
in
yorkshire
discover|discovered
an
old
and
more
gifted|gift
raven
at
a
village
public-house
,
which
he
prevail
upon
the
landlord
to
part
with
for
a
consideration
,
and
send
up
to
i
.
the
first
act
of
this
sage
,
be
,
to
administer
to
the
effect
of
he
predecessor
,
by
disinter
all
the
cheese
and
halfpence
he
have
bury|buried
in
the
garden
---
a
work
of
immense
labour
and
research
,
to
which
he
devote|devoted
all
the
energy
of
he
mind
.
when
he
have
achieve
this
task
,
he
apply|applied
himself
to
the
acquisition
of
stable
language
,
in
which
he
soon
become
such
an
adept
,
that
he
would
perch
outside
i
window
and
drive
imaginary
horse
with
great
skill
,
all
day
.
perhaps
even
i
never
see
he
at
he
good
,
for
he
former
master
send
he
duty
with
he
,
'
and
if
i
wish|wished
the
bird
to
come
out
very
strong
,
would
i
be
so
good
as
to
show
he
a
drunken
man
'
---
which
i
never
do
,
have
(
unfortunately
)
none
but
sober
people
at
hand
.
but
i
could
hardly
have
respect|respected
he
more
,
whatever
the
stimulating|stimulate
influence
of
this
sight
might
have
be
.
he
have
not
the
least
respect
,
i
be
sorry
to
say
,
for
i
in
return
,
or
for
anybody
but
the
cook
;
to
whom
he
be
attach|attached
---
but
only
,
i
fear
,
as
a
policeman
might
have
be
.
once
,
i
meet
he
unexpectedly
,
about
half-a-mile
from
i
house
,
walk|walking
down
the
middle
of
a
public
street
,
attend
by
a
pretty
large
crowd
,
and
spontaneously
exhibit
the
whole
of
he
accomplishment
.
he
gravity
under
those
try|trying
circumstance
,
i
can
never
forget
,
nor
the
extraordinary
gallantry
with
which
,
refuse
to
be
bring
home
,
he
defend
himself
behind
a
pump
,
until
overpower
by
number
.
it
may
have
be
that
he
be
too
bright
a
genius
to
live
long
,
or
it
may
have
be
that
he
take
some
pernicious
substance
into
he
bill
,
and
thence
into
he
maw
---
which
be
not
improbable
,
see|seeing
that
he
new-pointed
the
great
part
of
the
garden-wall
by
dig|digging
out
the
mortar
,
break|broke
countless
square
of
glass
by
scrape|scraping
away
the
putty
all
round
the
frame
,
and
tear
up
and
swallow|swallowed
,
in
splinter
,
the
great
part
of
a
wooden
staircase
of
six
step
and
a
landing|land
---
but
after
some
three
year
he
too
be
take|taken
ill
,
and
die
before
the
kitchen
fire
.
he
keep
he
eye
to
the
last
upon
the
meat
as
it
roast|roasted
,
and
suddenly
turn|turned
over
on
he
back
with
a
sepulchral
cry
of
'
cuckoo
!
'
since
then
i
have
be
ravenless
.
no
account
of
the
gordon
riot
have
be
to
i
knowledge
introduce|introduced
into
any
work
of
fiction
,
and
the
subject
present
very
extraordinary
and
remarkable
feature
,
i
be
lead
to
project
this
tale
.
it
be
unnecessary
to
say
,
that
those
shameful
tumult
,
while
they
reflect
indelible
disgrace
upon
the
time
in
which
they
occur
,
and
all
who
have
act
or
part
in
they
,
teach
a
good
lesson
.
that
what
we
falsely
call
a
religious
cry
be
easily
raise|raised
by
man
who
have
no
religion
,
and
who
in
they
daily
practice
set
at
nought
the
commone
principle
of
right
and
wrong
;
that
it
be
begotten
of
intolerance
and
persecution
;
that
it
be
senseless
,
besotted|besot
,
inveterate
and
unmerciful
;
all
history
teach
we
.
but
perhaps
we
do
not
know
it
in
we
heart
too
well
,
to
profit
by
even
so
humble
an
example
as
the
'
no
popery
'
riot
of
seventeen
hundred
and
eighty
.
however
imperfectly
those
disturbance
be
set
forth
in
the
following|follow
page
,
they
be
impartially
paint|painted
by
one
who
have
no
sympathy
with
the
romish
church
,
though
he

as
most
man

,
some
esteemed|esteem

among
the
follower

in
the
description
of
the
principal
outrage
,
reference
have

to
the
good
authority
of
that
time

such
as
they
be
;
the
account
give|given
in
this
tale
,
of
all
the
main
feature
of
the
riot
,
be
substantially
correct
.
mr

's
allusion
to
the
flourish|flourishing

any

of

,
with

small
child
,
turn
into
the
street
a-beg
.
it
be
a
circumstance
not
to
be
forget|forgotten
,
that
she
be
very
young
(
under
nineteen
)
,
and
most
remarkably
handsome

she
go
to
a
linen-draper
's
shop
,
take
some
coarse
linen
off
the
counter
,
and
slip|slipped
it
under
she
cloak
;
the
shopman
see
she
,
and
she
lay|laid
it
down
:
for
this
she
be
hang
.
she
defence
be
(
i
have
the
trial
in
i
pocket
)
,
"
that
she
have
live
in
credit
,
and
want|wanted
for
nothing
,
till
a
press-gang
come
and
steal
she
husband
from
she
;
but
since
then
,
she
have
no
bed
to
lie
on
;
nothing
to
give
she
child
to
eat
;
and
they
be
almost
naked
;
and
perhaps
she
might
have
do
something
wrong
,
for
she
hardly
know
what
she
do
.
"
the
parish
officer
testify
the
truth
of
this
story
;
but
it
seem
,
there
have
be
a
good
deal
of
shop-lifting
about
ludgate
;
an
example
be
think
necessary
;
and
this
woman
be
hang
for
the
comfort
and
satisfaction
of
shopkeeper
in
ludgate
street
.
when
bring
to
receive
sentence
,
she
behave
in
such
a
frantic
manner
,
as
prove
she
mind
to
be
in
a
distracted|distract
and
desponding
state
;
and
the
child
be
suck|sucking
at
she
breast
when

the
evening

do

be
neither
a
summer

twilight

day

branch

tree
,

rumble
in
the
wide
chimney

window

maypole
inn

give
such
of
it
frequenter
as
chance
to
be
there
at
the
moment
an
undeniable
reason
for
prolong
they
stay
,
and
cause
the
landlord
to
prophesy
that
the
night
would
certainly
clear
at
eleven
o'clock
precisely
,

which
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
be
the
hour
at
which

the
name

he
upon
whom
the
spirit
of
prophecy
thus
descend

john
willet

a
burly
,
large-headed
man
with
a
fat
face
,
which
betoken
profound
obstinacy
and
slowness
of
apprehension
,
combine|combined
with
a
very
strong
reliance
upon
he
own
merit
.
it
be
john
willet
's
ordinary
boast
in
he
more
placid
mood
that
if
he
be
slow
he
be
sure
;
which
assertion
could
,
in
one
sense
at
least
,
be
by
no
means
gainsay
,
see|seeing
that
he
be
in
everything
unquestionably
the
reverse
of
fast
,
and
withal
one
of
the
most
dogged|dog
and
positive
fellow
in
existence

always
sure
that
what
he
think
or
say|said
or
do
be
right
,

it

a
thing
quite
settle|settled

i
recollect
one
story
there
be
in
the
village

how
that
on
a
certain
night
in
the
year
(
it
might
be
that
very
night

know

,
all
the
dead
people
come
out

sit
at
the
head

own
grave
till
morning

this
make
i
think
how
many
people

have
know|known
,
be
bury|buried
between
the
church-door

,
and
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
to
have
to
pass
among
they
and
know
they
again
,
so
earthy
and
unlike
themselves
.
i
have
know|known
all
the
nich
and
arch
in
the
church
from
a
child
;
still
,
i
could
not
persuade
myself
that
those
be
they
natural
shadows|shadow

i
see
on

out

think|thinking
on
in

i
begin
to

of
the

have

look
up

something

in

as

have
play
in

passage
many
and
many
a
time
,
when
a
child
,
and
have
ever

of

haredale
,
whose
foster-sister
she

as
free
of

no

to

the
lively
room
in

building|build
.
the
chamber
be
sombre
like
the
rest
for
the
matter
of
that
,
but
the
presence
of
youth
and
beauty
would
make
a
prison
cheerful
(
save|saving
alas
!
that
confinement
wither
they
)
,
and
lend
some
charm
of

own
to

care
,
fill|filled
it
with
more
of

and
human
sympathy
than
the
whole
house
besides
seem
make
to
hold
.
there
be
heart
in
the
room
;
and
who
that
have
a
heart
,
ever
fail
to
recognise
the
silent
presence
of
another
!
dolly
have
one
undoubtedly
,
and
it
be
not
a
tough
one
either
,
though
there
be
a
little
mist
of
coquettishness
about
it
,
such
as
sometimes
surround
that
sun
of
life
in
it
morning
,
and
slightly
dim
it

.
thus
,
when
emma
rise|rose
to
greet
she
,
and
kissing|kiss
she
affectionately
on
the

,
tell|told
she
,
in
she
quiet
way
,
that
she
have
be
very
unhappy
,
the
tear
stand
in
dolly
's
eye
,
and
she
feel
more
sorry
than
she
could
tell
;
but
next
moment
she
happen
to
raise
they
to
the
glass
,
and
really
there
be
something
there
so
exceedingly
agreeable
,
that
as
she
sigh
,
she
smile
,
and
feel
surprisingly
console
.
'
i
have
hear
about
it
,
miss
,
'
say|said
dolly
,
'
and
it
be
very
sad
indeed
,
but
when
thing
be
at
the
bad
they
be
sure
to
mend
.
'
'
but
be
you
sure
they
be
at
the
bad
?
'
ask
emma
with
a
smile
.
'
why
,
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
very
well
be
more
unpromising
than
they
be
;
i
really
do
not
,
'
say|said
dolly
.
'
and
i
bring
something
to
begin
with
.
'
'
not
from
edward
?
'
dolly
nod
and
smile
,
and
feel|feeling
in
she
pocket
(
there
be
pocket
in
those
day
)
with
an
affectation
of
not
be
able
to
find
what
she
want|wanted
,
which
greatly
enhance|enhanced
she
importance
,
at

produce
the
letter
.
as
emma
hastily
break|broke
the
seal
and
become
absorb|absorbed
in
it
content
,
dolly
's
eye
,
by
one
of
those
strange
accident
for
which
there
be
no
accounting|account
,
wander
to
the
glass
again
.
she
could
not
help
wonder
whether
the
coach-maker
suffer
very
much
,
and
quite
pity
the
poor
man
.
it
be
a
long
letter
---
a
very
long
letter
,
write|written
close
on
all
four
side
of
the
sheet
of
paper
,
and
cross|crossed
afterwards
;
but
it
be
not
a
consolatory
letter
,
for
as
emma
read
it
she
stop|stopped
from
time
to
time
to
put
she
handkerchief
to
she
eye
.
to
be
sure
dolly
marvel
greatly
to
see
she
in
so
much
distress
,
for
to
she
thinking|think
a
love
affair
ought
to
be
one
of
the
good
joke
,
and
the
slyest
,
merry
kind
of
thing
in
life
.
but
she
set
it
down
in
she
own
mind
that
all
this
come
from
miss
haredale
be
be
so
constant
,
and
that
if
she
would
only
take
on
with
some
other
young
gentleman
---
just
in
the
most
innocent
way
possible
,
to
keep
she
first
lover
up
to
the
mark
---
she
would
find
herself
inexpressibly
comfort
.
'
i
be
sure
that
be
what
i
should
do
if
it
be
i
,
'
think
dolly
.
'
to
make
one
's
sweetheart
miserable
be
well
enough
and
quite
right
,
but
to
be
make
miserable
one
's
self
be
a
little
too
much
!
'
however
it
would
not
do
to
say
so
,
and
therefore
she
sit
look|looking
on
in
silence
.
she
need|needed
a
pretty
considerable
stretch
of
patience
,
for
when
the
long
letter
have
be
read
once
all
through
it
be
read
again
,
and
when
it
have
be

through

.
during
this
tedious
process
,
dolly
beguile
the
time
in
the
most
improving|improve
manner
that
occur
to
she
,
by
curl|curling
she
hair
on

with
the
aid
of

before

,
and
give|giving
it
some
killing|kill
twist

everything
have
an
end
.
even
young
lady
in
love
cannot
read
they
letter
for
ever
.
in

of
time
the
packet
be
fold|folded
up
,
and
it
only
remain
to
write
the
answer

but
as
this
promise|promised
to
be
a
work
of
time
likewise
,
emma
say|said
she
would
put
it
off
until
after
dinner
,
and
that
dolly

dine
with

as

,
she
require|required
very
little
pressing|press

when
they
have
settle|settled
this
point
,
they
go
to
walk
in

they
strol|strolled
up
and
down

,
talk|talking
incessantly

at

,
dolly
never
leave|left
off
once
---
and
make|making
that
quarter
of
the
sad
and
mournful
house
quite
gay
.
not
that
they
talk
loudly
or
laugh
much
,
but
they
be
both
so
very
handsome
,
and
it
be
such
a
breezy
day
,
and
they
light
dress
and
dark
curl
appear
so
free
and
joyous
in
they
abandonment
,
and
emma
be
so
fair
,
and
dolly
so
rosy
,
and
emma
so
delicately
shape|shaped
,
and
dolly
so
plump
,
and
---
in

,
there
be
no
flower
for
any

flower
,
let
horticulturist
say
what
they
may
,

both
house

to

.
after
this
,
come
the

the

some
more

,
in
the
course
of
which
miss

take
occasion
to
charge
upon
dolly
certain
flirtish
and

very
complimentary

to
she
that

(

dolly
stoutly
deny

with
a

haughty
protestation
that

and
so
forth
)
,
she
bid

farewell
;
and
after
call|calling
she
back
to

lightly
down

from

associate|associated
with

throw|threw
she
into
such
a

than
she
be
out

out
of

in

again

what
a

laugh
so
much
that
she

to
lean
against

tree
,

vent
to
she
exultation

laugh
no
long
,

quite
tired|tire
,
she
put
she
head-dress
to
right
,
dry|dried
she
eye
,

back
very
merrily
and
triumphantly
at
the

dusk

that
to

in

point

with
every
possible
turn

quite
an

out

that
man
be
himself
.
the
road
be
a
very
good
one
;
not

all
the
way

have
come
out
for

the
most
curious
circumstance
about
this
little
incident
be
,
that
dolly
do
not
seem
to
know
of
it
.
she
look
so
innocent

provoke|provoking

about

come|coming
up

enough

he
hope
,
dolly
be
quite
surprised|surprise
,
and
say|said
not
enemy
she
hope
;
and
when
joe
say|said
,
could
not
they
be
something
much
good
than
either
,
dolly
all
of
a
sudden
find
out
a
star
which
be
bright
than
all
the
other
star
,
and
beg
to
call
he
attention
to
the
same
,
and
be
ten
thousand
time
more
innocent
and
unconscious
than
ever
.
in
this
manner
they
travel
along
,
talk|talking
very
little

there
be
such
a
hush

mystery
about

that
joe

not

so
go
off
into

slumber

still

all
be
quiet
;

for
the

,

the
shaking|shake

he

mournfully
out

lie|lay

creep|creeping
back
to

about

the

away

begin
slowly
to
reveal
themselves
in
they
accustomed|accustom

;
the
grey-eyed
general

to
wink
and
yawn

rouse
himself
;
and
at
last

be
broad
awake
again
,
and
very
uncomfortable

cold

haggard
he

,
in
the
dull

the

begin
to

above

already

across

of

,
when
joe
drop
from

window
on
the
ground
below
,
a
little
bundle
and
he
trusty
stick
,
and
prepare
to
descend
himself
.
it
be
not
a
very
difficult
task
;
for
there
be
so
many
projection
and
gable
end
in
the
way
,
that
they
form
a
series
of
clumsy
step
,
with
no
great
obstacle
than
a
jump
of
some
few
foot
at
last
.
joe
,
with
he
stick
and
bundle
on

shoulder
,
quickly
stand
on
the
firm
earth
,
and
look
up
at
the
old
maypole
,
it
might
be
for

he

,
for

he

for

he

kind
to
it
than
ever
he
have
do
in
all
he
life
before

so
say|said
with
all
he
heart
,
'
god

'
as
a
parting|part

,
and
turn|turned
away
.
he
walk
along
at

,
big
with
great
thought
of
go|going
for

in

until

in

and
the

in

it
be
only
eight
o'clock

,
as

the

in

:
that

mr

extreme
sagacity

acuteness

the
effort

the

of

the
one

which

the
creaking
lion
over

house-door
be
,
therefore
,
to
say
the
truth
,
rather
a
drowsy
,
tame
,
and
feeble
lion
;
and
as
these

from

point|pointed
out

significantly
the

part

how
easy
it
be
to
get
into
the
lobby
,
and
so
to
the
very
door
of
the
house
of
commons
;
and
how
plainly
,
when
they
march
down
there
in
grand
array
,
they
roar
and
shout
would
be
hear
by
the

inside
;
with
a
great
deal
more
to

purpose
,
all
of

hugh
receive|received

he
tell|told

,
too
,
who
some
of

as
they
come
in

out
;
whether

take
notice

,
both
in

,

much
acquaintance
with

around
,
that
it
be
plain
he
have
often
study|studied
there
before

as
indeed
,
when
they
grow
a
little
more
confidential
,

confess

perhaps
the
most
striking|strike
part
of
all
this
be
,
the
number
of
people
---
never
in
group
of
more
than
two
or
three
together
---
who
seem
to
be
skulk
about
the
crowd
for
the

purpose

to
the
great
part
of
these
,
a
slight
nod

a
look
from
hugh
's
companion
be
sufficient
greeting|greet
;
but
,
now
and
then
,
some
man
would
come
and
stand
beside

in
the
throng
,
and
,
without
turn|turning
he
head
or
appear
to
communicate
with

,
would
say
a
word
or
two
in
a
low
voice
,
which
he
would
answer
in
the
same
cautious
manner
.
then
they
would
part
,
like
stranger
.
some
of
these
man
often
reappear
again
unexpectedly
in
the
crowd
close
to
hugh
,
and
,
as
they
pass|passed
by
,
press
he
hand
,
or
look
he
sternly
in
the
face
;
but
they
never
speak
to
he
,
nor
he
to
they
;
no
,
not
a

it
be
remarkable
,
too
,
that
whenever

to

where
there
be
any
press
of

,
and
hugh

to

downward

he
be
sure
to
see
an
arm
stretch|stretched
out
---
under

perhaps
,
or
perhaps
across
he
---
which
thrust
some
paper
into
the
hand
or
pocket
of
a
bystander
,
and
be
so
suddenly
withdraw
that
it
be
impossible
to
tell
from
whom
it
come
;
nor
could
he
see
in
any
face
,
on
glance
quickly
round
,
the
least
confusion
or
surprise
.
they
often
tread
upon
a
paper
like
the
one
he
carry
in
he
breast
,
but
he
companion
whisper|whispered
he
not
to
touch
it
or
to
take

up
,
---
not
even
to

towards
it
,

so
there
they
let
they
lie
,
and
pass|passed
on
.
when

that

for

:
'
since
the
night
of

storm

in
short
,
since
the
last
nineteenth
of

'
as
though
he
fear|feared
that

might
express
surprise
,
or
reason
with
he
,
he
hastily
go
on
:

you

i

i
labour

perhaps
i
do

'
with
that
,
as
if
to
change
the
theme

he
lead
the
astounded
locksmith
back

the
night
of

maypole
highwayman
,
to
the
robbery
of
edward

to
the
reappearance

man

to
all
the
strange

even
ask

carelessly
about
the
man

he

whether
he

put
many
question

that
sort

the

,
consider
they
as

device
to
engage
he
attention
and
prevent

the
astonishment
he
feel
,
answer
pretty
much
at

.
at
length

corner

the
street

the
house

if

he
say|said
,
turn|turning
to
the
locksmith
with
a
gloomy
smile
,
'
you
can

'
gabriel
,
to
whom
all
former
marvel
have
be
nothing
in
comparison
with
this
,
follow
he
along
the
narrow
pavement
in
silence

door
,

softly
open|opened
it

key

about

it

they
grope
they
way
into

ground-floor
room

here
mr

strike
a
light
,
and
kindle|kindled
a
pocket
taper
he
have
bring
with
he
for
the
purpose

it
be
then
,
when

full
upon

;
how
perfectly

with
all
that
he
have
say
so
strangely
as
they
ride
along
.
it
be
not
an
unnatural
impulse
in
gabriel
,
after
what
he
have
hear
,
to
note
curiously
the
expression
of
he
eye
.
it
be
perfectly
collect|collected
and
rational
;
---
so
much
so
,
indeed
,
that
he
feel
ashamed
of
he
momentary
suspicion
,
and
droop
he
own
when
mr
haredale
look
towards
he
,
as
if
he
fear|feared
they
would
betray
he
thought
.
'

you
walk
through

with
a
glance
towards

crazy
shutter

the

in

of

there
appear
to

more
of

there

hitherto
;
and
they
could
no

hear
the

which
they
have
before
plainly
distinguish|distinguished

some
new
excitement
,
too
,
seem
to
prevail
among

;
for
there
be
much

they
be
now
very
subdued|subdue
and

,
converse

and
steal|stealing

with
a

very

hitherto

whether
this

by
the

some
person

in

rank
,
or
by
any

cause
,
they
be
unable

sometimes
they
think
it
be

for

provoke
a

to

even

by

it

sufficiently
evident
,
both
to
emma

to
the
locksmith
's
poor
little
daughter
herself
,
that
she

dolly

be
the

hugh

she
liken
herself
unto

,

a

round-house

the
charge

he
be
numerous

weighty

and
it
be
in

prove
,
by
the

that
he
have
show
a

desire
to

,
he
be
commit|committed

moreover

of

the

that

be
altogether
prepare|prepared

would
be
to

a

amount

indeed
this

's
stoicism
be
of
that
not

kind
,
which
enable
a
man
to
bear
with
exemplary
fortitude
the
affliction

counterpoise

rather
selfish

it

no

to

the

when

,
the

,
be
matter

but
certain
it
be
that
for
a
whole
year
he
never
indulge
in
any

than

croak
.
at

before

'

i

i

'
with
extraordinary
rapture

from

period
(
although

,
he

and
,
as

probably
go
